     * <i>Height files have the extension .HGT, and the DEM is provided as two-byte
     * (16-bit) binary signed integer raster data. Two-byte signed integers can
     * range from -32,767 to 32,767 m and can encompass the range of the Earthâ€™s
     * elevations. Header or trailer bytes are not embedded in the file. The data
     * are stored in row major order, meaning all the data for the northernmost row,
     * row 1, are followed by all the data for row 2, and so on.
     *
     * The two-byte data are in Motorola "big-endian" order with the most
     * significant byte first. Most personal computers, and Macintosh computers
     * built after 2006 use Intel ("little-endian") order so byte swapping may be
     * necessary. Some software programs perform the swapping during ingest.
     *
     * Voids in Versions 1.0 and 2.1 are flagged with the value -32,768. There are
     * no voids in Version 3.0.</i>
     *
     * @param srtmFile The SRTM file to read.
     * @param type     The type of SRTM file, SRTM1 or SRTM3.
     * @return The SRTM tile read from the file.
     * @throws IOException Thrown if the data in the file has a wrong length or the
     *                     file cannot be read at all.
